# Tuya Device Controller - Product Requirements Document

A web-based interface for discovering and controlling Tuya smart home devices with basic on/off functionality.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Reliable** - Device states should be clearly indicated and updates should feel instantaneous
2. **Intuitive** - Device controls should be immediately understandable without explanation  
3. **Professional** - Interface should feel polished and trustworthy for smart home management

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
This app manages device discovery, state persistence, and real-time control interactions but doesn't require complex user accounts or advanced workflows.

## Essential Features

### Device Discovery
- **Functionality**: Scan network for available Tuya devices and display them in a list
- **Purpose**: Allow users to find and connect to their smart home devices
- **Trigger**: Manual scan button or automatic scan on app load
- **Progression**: Click scan → Loading indicator → Devices populate in grid → Success message
- **Success criteria**: Discovered devices appear with name, type, and current status

### Device Control (On/Off)
- **Functionality**: Toggle power state of individual devices with immediate visual feedback
- **Purpose**: Provide quick, reliable control over smart home devices
- **Trigger**: Click device power toggle button
- **Progression**: Click toggle → Optimistic UI update → API call → Confirmation/rollback on error
- **Success criteria**: Device state changes both visually and physically within 2 seconds

### Device Status Display
- **Functionality**: Show current power state, connection status, and device information
- **Purpose**: Give users clear visibility into their smart home ecosystem
- **Trigger**: Automatic on device discovery and state changes
- **Progression**: Device data received → Parse status → Update UI indicators → Persist state
- **Success criteria**: Status indicators accurately reflect actual device states

### Connection Management
- **Functionality**: Handle device connections, timeouts, and reconnection attempts
- **Purpose**: Maintain reliable communication with Tuya devices
- **Trigger**: Device communication failures or network changes
- **Progression**: Connection lost → Show warning → Retry attempts → Success/failure notification
- **Success criteria**: Users are informed of connection issues and resolution attempts

## Edge Case Handling
- **No devices found**: Display helpful message with troubleshooting tips
- **Network timeout**: Show retry option with clear error messaging
- **Device unreachable**: Gray out device with reconnect button
- **API rate limiting**: Queue commands and show pending status
- **Simultaneous control**: Prevent conflicting commands with loading states

## Design Direction
The interface should feel modern, clean, and trustworthy - similar to premium smart home apps like Philips Hue or Apple Home, emphasizing clarity and reliability over flashy animations.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme for clear device state communication and visual hierarchy.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (#1e40af) - Communicates trust and technology reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays (#6b7280, #f3f4f6) for backgrounds and supporting elements  
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Green (#10b981) for active/on states and success feedback
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray #f9fafb): Dark Gray text (#111827) - Ratio 16.1:1 ✓
  - Card (White #ffffff): Dark Gray text (#111827) - Ratio 18.7:1 ✓  
  - Primary (Deep Blue #1e40af): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Green #10b981): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Clean, technical sans-serif typography that conveys precision and modernity, using Inter for its excellent readability at all sizes.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Device Names): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Status Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed spacing
  - Small (Device Details): Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that provide feedback and guide attention without feeling distracting - focused on state transitions and loading indicators.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces the reliability theme through smooth, predictable transitions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Device state toggles get primary animation focus, followed by discovery loading states

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Cards for device display, Buttons for controls, Badges for status, Skeleton for loading states, Alerts for notifications
- **Customizations**: Custom device card component with integrated toggle controls and status indicators
- **States**: Toggle buttons show clear on/off states with color and position changes, disabled states during API calls
- **Icon Selection**: Power icons for on/off, WiFi icons for connection status, Refresh for discovery
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-unit (16px) grid spacing with 6-unit (24px) gaps between device cards
- **Mobile**: Single column layout on mobile with larger touch targets, collapsible device details
